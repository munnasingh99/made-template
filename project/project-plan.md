# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Adoption of renewable energy sources affecting green house gas emmissions in europe.
## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How has the adoption of renewable energy sources impacted greenhouse gas emissions in Europe over the last two decades?
## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
In recent times, many countries are focussing towards renewable energy sources as primary sources of energy. In this project we will try to find out
whether adopting renewable energy source in mainstream energy pipeline will affect green house gas emmission across Europe, if it does affect then whether it is direct correlation or there are many other factors affecting the reduction in green house gas emmission in europe.
